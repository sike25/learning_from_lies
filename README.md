### Abstract 

Training deep neural networks at scale is increasingly contrained by fundamental problems of data scarcity. In this project, we propose a fast and cheap pipeline for online data generation in trainign supervised learning models. 

Our pipeline introduces a warm-up phase where data is procedurally generated on the fly, eliminating disk-based data laoading overhead. This synthetic data can be adapted to model weaknesses through an adversarial reinforcement learning framework.
